// NOTE: Only double and double_complex matrices are modeled. This file is intened to make it easier to create and use BLAS and LAPACK matrices and functions. It is written in C to allow easier portability between Macs and Windows machines. There are some preprocessor directives for correct compilation but the underlying projects will need to load the correct framework/library.

// NOTE: All buffers are assumed to be in COLUMN-MAJOR order.

// NOTE: We use "UPLO = U" symantics for symmetric, positive-definite, and hermitian matrices

// Since this is C, we don't have access to classes. So we define a struct instead. Most of the routines in this library take a BLAS_Matrix struct pointer as their first argument (I suppose I could pass the structs as values). Routines that call the matrix creation routines should check the value of status before using the Matrix. In the event of an LAPACK call error where the "info" argument holds the error code, the matrix routine will return LAPACK_ROUTINE_ERROR with the code in lapack_info field. If an error occurs during one of the Solve...LinearSystem calls, the status will hold SOLVE_MATRIX_ERROR with the underlying LAPACK info error in lapack_info.

Any routine that returns a SolveResult will set the resultIsValid field before returning. If resultIsValid is false, then it is guaranteed that all the pointers in the struct have been released and set to NULL.
