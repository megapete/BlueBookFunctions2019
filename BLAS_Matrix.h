// NOTE: Only double and double_complex matrices are modeled. This file is intened to make it easier to create and use BLAS and LAPACK matrices and functions. It is written in C to allow easier portability between Macs and Windows machines. There are some preprocessor directives for correct compilation but the underlying projects will need to load the correct framework/library.

// NOTE: All buffers are assumed to be in COLUMN-MAJOR order

// NOTE: We "UPLO = U" symantics for symmetric matrices
